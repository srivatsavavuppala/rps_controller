# **App Name**: RPS Playground

## Core Features:

- Element Display and Animation: Display 10 rock, 10 paper, and 10 scissor elements within a defined window. The elements should have an animation that makes them appear to float randomly.
- Game Logic: Implement the game logic: Rock touches Paper -> Rock becomes Paper; Rock touches Scissor -> Scissor becomes Rock; Scissor touches Paper -> Paper becomes Scissor. Objects touching should change almost immediately. If several valid transformations exist at the same time, let an AI tool decide the order that transformations should take place in.
- Live Count Display: Display a live count of the number of rock, paper, and scissor elements in the window.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Slate blue (#5F9EA0) to evoke a sense of playful interaction and balance. It should hint at water which smooths and transforms stone.
- Background color: Very light desaturated cyan (#F0FFFF), to contrast with the elements, while being gentle and not too distracting.
- Accent color: Light orange (#E07A5F) to highlight interactive elements and the count display.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif with a modern look.
- Use simple, flat icons for rock, paper, and scissors. The style should be clean and easily distinguishable.
- The live count should be displayed at the top of the window, with clear labels for each element type.
- Implement a subtle floating animation for the elements, creating a sense of randomness. Consider easing functions for natural movement.
